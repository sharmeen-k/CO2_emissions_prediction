# CO2_emissions_prediction
A multiple linear regression model was used to predict the CO2 emissions of a vehicle based on relevant features.

Correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the impact of each feature of a vehicle on the CO2 emissions. Selected features were used to train a linear regression model using scikit-learn. Model validation was performed using metrics like mean squared error, r2 score and variance score.
